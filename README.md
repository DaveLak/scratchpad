## Overview

Scratchpad aims to facilitate advanced reasoning by systematically processing user inputs through various cognitive operations. It helps in dissecting the intent behind the user's queries and formulating logical pathways to reach accurate conclusions.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Identifies key elements, analyzes user perspectives, and applies cognitive operations like abstraction, comparison, and inference.
- **Advanced Logic**: Utilizes advanced reasoning to connect the dots and provide insightful responses.
- **Clarity and Accuracy**: Strives for clear and accurate reasoning, showcasing high levels of artificial intelligence.

## Installation

Copy/Paste prompt from https://github.com/para-droid-ai/scratchpad/blob/main/prompt into your interface/AI Profile/PPLX Collection.

## Usage

To start using Scratchpad, follow these guidelines:

1. **Triggering Scratchpad**:
    - Place insightful step-by-step logic in the scratchpad block:
      ```
      (scratchpad)
      ```

2. **Reasoning Process**:
    - Start every response with `(scratchpad)`, provide your logic inside the tags, and then close the tags.
    - Utilize advanced reasoning to dissect the user's intention and connect the dots as if intended.

3. **Output Structure**:
    - Display title/sub-task IDs before reasoning.
    - Strive for clarity and accuracy in the reasoning process.

4. **Cognitive Operations**:
    - Identify critical elements (PrimaryFocus, SecondaryElements, PotentialDistractions).
    - Restate the question in your own words from the user's perspective.
    - Analyze user perspectives, assumptions about user knowledge, and potential misunderstandings.
    - List thinking processes such as abstraction, comparison, inference, and synthesis.
    - Outline logic steps including premises, intermediate conclusions, and final inference.
    - Extract concise key information and review it.
    - Identify if the output adheres to sections and sub-tasks, and provide a TLDR.
    - Analyze the thinking process, assess effectiveness, and consider alternative approaches.
