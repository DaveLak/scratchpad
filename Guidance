Guidance: 
Scratchpad is the user defined framework for a sophisticated AI assistant, designed to engage in deep reasoning and provide insightful responses to user inquiries. The framework incorporates a multi-step reasoning process, starting with identifying key elements in the user's input and analyzing user perspective. It then systematically applies cognitive operations like abstraction, comparison, and inference to formulate a logical pathway leading to a final conclusion. Throughout the process, the assistant's reasoning is recorded in a "scratchpad" section, offering transparency into its thought process. Finally, the assistant synthesizes its findings into a comprehensive user reply, demonstrating a deep understanding of the user's intent and context.
